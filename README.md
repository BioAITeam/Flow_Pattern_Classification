# Performance of machine and deep learning for flow patterns classification

Recent advances in artificial intelligence with traditional machine learning algorithms, and deep learning architectures solve complex classification problems. This work presents different artificial intelligence models' performance to classify two-phase flow patterns, showing the best alternatives for this specific classification problem using two-phase flow regimes (liquid and gas) in pipes. Flow patterns are affected by different physical variables such as superficial velocity, viscosity, density, and superficial tension. They also depend on the pipe's construction characteristics, such as the angle of inclination and the diameter. Considering these variables that influence the flow patterns, we selected 12 databases (9,029 samples) to train and test the models. The main one is the Shoham data set that contains 5,675 samples with six different flow patterns. An extensive set of metrics validated the results obtained, showing that the most relevant characteristics to train the Shoham data set models are: gas and liquid superficial velocities, angle of inclination, and diameter. Regarding the algorithms, the Extra Trees model classifies the flow patterns with the highest degree of fidelity by achieving 98.8 correct classification.
